# Stolen Bikes Index - Front End Challenge

![JOIN Stolen Bike Cases](https://github.com/chiper-inc/React-Web-Coding-Challenge/blob/master/illustration.png)


## Description

Stolen bikes are a typical problem in Berlin. so I created this application for the police to be much more efficient when solving cases. With this application they can automate their processes.

## Things you can do

As a police officer:

- [✔] I can see a list of reported bike thefts for the Berlin area.
- [✔] I can see the first 10 bike theft cases, with the ability to - paginate (10 cases per page).
- [✔] I can see a total number of bike theft cases.
- [✔] For each reported bike theft I can see:
  - [✔] Case title
  - [✔] Case description
  - [✔] Date of the theft
  - [✔] Date of when the case was reported
  - [✔] Location of the theft
  - [✔] Picture of the bike, if available
- [✔] I can filter reported bike thefts by partial case title.
- [✔] I can filter reported bike thefts by date range.
- [✔] I can see a loading state until the list is available.
- [✔] I can see an error state if the list is unavailable.
- [✔] I can see an empty state if there are no results.

## how to open the app
